I typically love Rust.
Rust is a better language for the things I do than any other language.
However Rust is also far from perfect and sometimes I hate Rust and wish I was using C++ instead.
This post is a list of the various ways in which I end up hating Rust.

## Initializing unsigned integers to negative literals

When working on winapi I'll frequently run into cases where a header initializes an enum variant to a negative value or it defines a macro constant to a negative unsigned integer literal.
Unfortunately Rust refuses to let me have negative unsigned integer literals: ```error: cannot apply unary operator `-` to type `u32` ```.
If I try to instead do something clever like `0 - 100` then Rust informs me I shouldn't do that either: `warning: constant evaluation error: attempt to subtract with overflow. This will become a HARD ERROR in the future`.
So I end up having to do ugly things like `-1i32 as u32` or `(FOO as i32 - 100) as u32`.

## No ident concatenation in `macro_rules!` macros

This is a big pain point causing macro invocations to be far more verbose than they have to be.
I've been promised a better macro system for *years* which would fix this issue and I'm still waiting.
At the moment it looks like it'll be more likely that procedural macros will be stabilized first, in which case I'd have to replace my macros with a much more complex procedural macro just to get ident concatenation.
