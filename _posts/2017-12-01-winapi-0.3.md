title: winapi 0.3
published: false
---

For over a year people have been wondering when the next version of winapi would be published, and today I am happy to announce that winapi 0.3 has finally been [published to crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/winapi)! This new version has a lot of changes so this post will go over them and any changes that will be necessary in your own code when migrating to this new version.

## The `-sys` crates are dead. Long live the `winapi` behemoth.

In previous versions of `winapi`, function bindings were separated into their own independent crates based on which import library contained those symbols. For example, the `MessageBoxW` function is exported from `user32.lib`, and was thus bound in the `user32-sys` crate.

In 0.3, this is no longer true: the `winapi` crate contains all types, constants, macros, *and* functions. As such, dependencies on all `-sys` crates in the winapi family should be removed, and all imports updated to point towards `winapi` itself.

All of the `-sys` crates on `crates.io` are now deprecated and will have all their versions yanked in the near future to prevent future projects from using them. If you still have a project using these, it will continue to work, but if you need to add additional `-sys` crates, you'll need to migrate to `winapi-0.3` instead.

## Items are now organised into modules.

Binding items in `winapi` were previously not organised into modules. This allowed you to use a type, or constant without having to consider where it was defined. If C code or documentation mentioned `HWND`, then it was available as `winapi::HWND`, irrespective of the C header required.

In 0.3, all items are organised into modules based on the Windows SDK header file that defines them. So if you are already familiar with the file structure of the Windows SDK headers, `winapi` now directly mirrors that \[[†](#fn†)]. So in `winapi` 0.3 `HWND` is now located at `shared::windef::HWND`. And to continue the example of `MessageBoxW`, which is defined in `winuser.h`, it's now available in the `um::winuser` module.

You can determine where an item (or the module that corresponds to a particular header) is located by searching the [online `winapi` 0.3 documentation]. Most translated headers will be in the `um` (user-mode) top-level module, items shared between user- and kernel-mode code in the `shared` module, Visual C++-specific items in the `vc` module, and WinRT-related items in the `winrt` module.

If given a choice between using names from both `shared` and `um` (as the latter re-exports items from the former), and you are not writing code intended to run in the kernel (*i.e.* device drivers), stick to `um`. There is no difference between the two, but using the `um` modules better matches the conventions of writing user-mode code.

Note: if you are familiar with the file structure of the Windows SDK headers, `winapi` now directly mirrors that.

## Modules gated on feature flags

All binding modules are gated behind Cargo feature flags. This means that in order to access the contents of a module, you must first enable the corresponding feature flag on the `winapi` crate. For example, to use `MessageBoxW` in the `um::winuser` module, you must enable the `winuser` feature.

Note that enabling a module *also* enables any modules it depends on for types. For example, `MessageBoxW`'s definition requires `HWND`. As a result, enabling the `winuser` feature *also* enables (among others) the `windef` feature, so that `HWND` is defined.

Features also control which DLLs will be linked. Enabling `winuser` automatically causes your program to be linked against the `User32` library.

There is also an `everything` feature that enables all other feature gates. Enabling everything will adversely affect build times. \[[‡](#fn‡)]

## COM interfaces

All COM interfaces now implement the `Interface` trait, which will allow better `ComPtr` abstractions. Currently this trait exposes a single method which returns the IID of the interface which is essential for `QueryInterface` wrappers. For example, to get the IID of the `IUnknown` interface, call `IUnknown::uuidof()`.

## Enumerations

Previously, each `enum` was translated to a "newtype" structure. For example, the definition of `POINTER_INPUT_TYPE` in `winapi` 0.2 was equivalent to:

```rust
pub struct POINTER_INPUT_TYPE(pub u32);
pub const PT_POINTER: POINTER_INPUT_TYPE = POINTER_INPUT_TYPE(0x00000001);
pub const PT_TOUCH: POINTER_INPUT_TYPE = POINTER_INPUT_TYPE(0x00000002);
pub const PT_PEN: POINTER_INPUT_TYPE = POINTER_INPUT_TYPE(0x00000003);
pub const PT_MOUSE: POINTER_INPUT_TYPE = POINTER_INPUT_TYPE(0x00000004);
pub const PT_TOUCHPAD: POINTER_INPUT_TYPE = POINTER_INPUT_TYPE(0x00000005);
```

For `winapi` 0.3, enumerations are instead type aliases to the underlying integer type. The equivalent to the above in 0.3 is:

```rust
pub type POINTER_INPUT_TYPE = u32;
pub const PT_POINTER: POINTER_INPUT_TYPE = 0x00000001;
pub const PT_TOUCH: POINTER_INPUT_TYPE = 0x00000002;
pub const PT_PEN: POINTER_INPUT_TYPE = 0x00000003;
pub const PT_MOUSE: POINTER_INPUT_TYPE = 0x00000004;
pub const PT_TOUCHPAD: POINTER_INPUT_TYPE = 0x00000005;
```

## Standard library support and `c_void`.

`winapi` now defaults to *not* linking against the standard library. There is only one situation in which this will be a problem: when you wish to use `winapi` definitions with other code that uses the `c_void` type.

`winapi` defines a number of C-compatible types in the top-level `ctypes` module. All of these are aliases to the "real" type (*e.g.* `type c_char = i8;`). The exception is `c_void` which does not have a single, corresponding Rust type. As such, by default, `winapi` defines its own `c_void` type.

However, this `c_void` will not be compatible with `c_void` as used by any other code, unless that code is specifically using `winapi`'s type. This can be fixed by enabling the `std` feature, which causes `winapi::ctypes::c_void` to instead alias to `std::os::raw::c_void`.

## Simply Migration Example

To make the migration of a project a little more clear, we'll show an example of a simple GUI Hello World example in both `winapi` 0.2 and 0.3.

In `winapi-0.2` it looks like:

```rust
//! Add the following to `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```cargo
//! [dependencies]
//! winapi = "0.2"
//! user32-sys = "0.2"
//! ```

extern crate winapi;
extern crate user32;
use std::io::Error;

fn print_message(msg: &str) -> Result<i32, Error> {
    use std::ffi::OsStr;
    use std::iter::once;
    use std::os::windows::ffi::OsStrExt;
    use std::ptr::null_mut;
    use winapi::MB_OK;
    use user32::MessageBoxW;
    let wide: Vec<u16> = OsStr::new(msg).encode_wide().chain(once(0)).collect();
    let ret = unsafe {
        MessageBoxW(null_mut(), wide.as_ptr(), wide.as_ptr(), MB_OK)
    };
    if ret == 0 { Err(Error::last_os_error()) }
    else { Ok(ret) }
}

fn main() {
    print_message("Hello, world!").unwrap();
}
```

It would be modified as follows for `winapi-0.3`.

```rust
//! Add the following to `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```cargo
//! [dependencies.winapi]
//! version = "0.3"
//! features = ["winuser"] # enable the `um::winuser` module.
//!
//! # No dependency on `user32-sys`.
//! ```

extern crate winapi;
// No `extern crate user32;`.
use std::io::Error;

fn print_message(msg: &str) -> Result<i32, Error> {
    use std::ffi::OsStr;
    use std::iter::once;
    use std::os::windows::ffi::OsStrExt;
    use std::ptr::null_mut;
    // `MB_OK` and `MessageBoxW` are in a module.
    use winapi::um::winuser::{MB_OK, MessageBoxW};
    let wide: Vec<u16> = OsStr::new(msg).encode_wide().chain(once(0)).collect();
    let ret = unsafe {
        MessageBoxW(null_mut(), wide.as_ptr(), wide.as_ptr(), MB_OK)
    };
    if ret == 0 { Err(Error::last_os_error()) }
    else { Ok(ret) }
}

fn main() {
    print_message("Hello, world!").unwrap();
}
```

\[†]: This is due to the existence of duplicate, non-compatible definitions in the Windows SDK. The SDK gets around this via abuse of the C pre-processor to redefine names based on the order in which header files are included.

\[‡]: You will not just have time to make a cup of coffee. You will have time to fly to the coffee belt, harvest the beans, fly back, roast them, grind them, and *then* make a cup of coffee. It will still be faster than compiling `winapi = "0.2"` though.
